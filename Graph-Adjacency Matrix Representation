Graph-Adjacency Matrix Representation
Write a program to implement a graph using an adjacency Matrix.



Example:

Input:

4

4

yes

1 2 6

2 3 7

3 4 8

2 4 9

Output:

Please enter the number of nodes in the graph

Please enter the number of edges in the graph

Is the graph directed

Adjacency Matrix Representation:

0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0

Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 1

Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 2

Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 3

Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 4

Adjacency Matrix Representation:

0 6 0 0

0 0 7 9

0 0 0 8

0 0 0 0


Case 1
Input (stdin)
4
4
yes
1 2 6
2 3 7
3 4 8
2 4 9

Output (stdout)
Please enter the number of nodes in the graph
Please enter the number of edges in the graph
Is the graph directed
Adjacency Matrix Representation:
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 1
Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 2
Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 3
Enter the start node, end node and weight of edge no 4
